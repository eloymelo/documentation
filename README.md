# Documentation
<h2>A gathering of instructions that I often use when I am working with Linux, Windows or macOS.</h2>

<p>The goal of this repository is to have all instructions documented so it's easy to access whenever I (or someone else) need it in order to accomplish something within theses guidelines.</p>
