# Linux Documentation
<h3>A gathering of instructions that I often use to tweak and create a better experience while using my daily linux machine.</h3>

<p>The goal of this repository is to have all instructions documented so it's easy to access whenever I (or someone else) need it in order to accomplish something within theses guidelines.</p>
