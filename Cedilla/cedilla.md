<h1>Simple fix for those who are using a keyboard with the US layout and cannot type the "รง".</h1>

1. Create a hidden file in your home directory (~/) called ".XCompose.

        sudo nano .XCompose

2. Copy and paste the following:

        <dead_acute> <c>     : "รง"
        <dead_acute> <C>     : "ร"

3. Ctrl + O to save it and ctrl + X to close nano.

4. Done.
